<p>
The door can be displayed, as is, indoors or out, on a wall or table. <u>However, it may also be removed from the backing and installed on a tree.</u>
</p>

<p>
Thank you for inviting a gnome to move on to your property. By installing the door, you offer a nomadic, or homeless, gnome a friendly safe space to live. If you follow the steps below carefully, you will have the best chance of a gnome moving in<sup>*</sup>.
</p>
<p>The door can be removed from the wood backing. (see photos below) Gently tap the mounting nail from behind and slowly and carefully pull the door away from the backing wood. Save the spanish moss.
</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li>Find a tree, or wood wall, where you would like to install your door (like photo). Gnomes prefer if the spot is slightly hidden so they can come and go privately</li>
<li>Spread out the Spanish Moss behind the door and place the door where you would like to install it on the tree</li>
<li>Tap the nail through the charm and door and into the tree until it is flush with the door. Be careful not to miss the nail!</li>
<li>Over the next few days, the space behind the door will magically turn into a fully furnished gnome home.</li>
<li>Find a pile of small rocks, pebbles, glass beads or other to make a walkway. Place the welcome walkway stones in an inviting manner in front of the door.</li>
<li>Gnomes love shiny objects, so feel free to add additional bling near the door to help attract one.</li>
<li>Keep peeking out your window to see if you can catch a glimpse of one moving in!</li>
<li>Once a year, spray the door with satin clear coat protectant.</li>

* installing the door does not guarantee a gnome will move in, but they might! They do enjoy their anonymity though, so you may never get a chance to meet them.
